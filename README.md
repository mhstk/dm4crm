# DM4CRM
## A GUI Data Mining Service for SuiteCRM

This is the output system of my bachelor's thesis project at Amirkabir University. In this project, I developed a GUI analytical system that can extract data from an open source CRM called SuiteCRM and other data sources and is able to perform different transformation on the data and prepare it for data mining processes and even machine learning algorithms. This tool can generate python code which uses Pandas+Scikit-learn or Pyspark and run them with different engines for the analytical process.
